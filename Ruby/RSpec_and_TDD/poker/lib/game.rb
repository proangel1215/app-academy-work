#the method for award_pot should probably be able to take in 2 parameters. B/c you can have 1 winner....but you can also have a case where the pot needs to be split. So maybe this method takes in an array of players.

# NEED TO ACCOUNT FOR SITUATIONS LIKE THIS....THERE WILL NEED TO BE A SECOND TEST....IMAGINE TWO 5S VS TWO 8S....NEED TO APPLY THIS ACROSS ALL HANDS
