            On Wednesday, President Joe Biden announced new programs to tackle climate change, including $2.3 billion to help
            communities retrofit buildings and expand flood controls. Indeed, governments and corporations across the world are
            adopting ESG (Environmental Social Governance) policies to deal with climate change concerns.
            However, the “emotional” reaction to climate change has weakened economic growth and caused inflation, said Frank
            Holmes, CEO of U.S. Global Investors and Executive Chairman of HIVE Blockchain.

            “Climate change is basically embedding inflation,” said Holmes. “A lot of [inflation] has to do with energy inflation in
            Europe, with a panic shutdown of nuclear power in Spain and Germany, and with taxation on cars and trucks.”
            Holmes, who correctly predicted a market boom in 2020, is now forecasting that by Thanksgiving, the Federal Reserve will
            reverse course on its monetary tightening and reduce interest rates.
            He spoke with David Lin, Anchor and Producer at Kitco News.
